This project showcases a simple RAG implementation using OpenAI API.
The source data is the public NLTK book (https://www.nltk.org/book/), which is a NLP library for Python that I used in school.
It can be queried directly using a Jupyter notebook for quick insight into the content. This is mostly for exploration purposes, otherwise we would want to use a text interface and a more object oriented setup.
The answers will only use the given context and return sources for the parts that it used for its answers.
